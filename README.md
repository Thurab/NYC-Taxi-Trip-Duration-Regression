# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Regression
Predicting the taxi trip duration from NYC data


**Problem Statement**

A typical taxi company faces a common problem of efficiently
assigning the cabs to passengers so that the service is smooth
and hassle free. One of main issue is determining the duration
of the current trip so it can predict when the cab will
be free for the next trip.
The data set contains the data regarding several taxi trips and its duration in New York City. I will now try and apply different techniques of Data Analysis to get insights about the data and determine how different variables are dependent on the target variable Trip Duration.

**The followings are performed through out the project,**

•	Performed EDA.

•	Removed outliers.

•	Checked Multicollinearity.

•	Trained 80% and Tested 20% with the data.

•	Applied various models to the training and testing data to predict trip duration.

•	Applied GridCV cross validation to figure out the learning rate and regression strength of the model to come up with good R2 score.
